<p>SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>PREAMBLE</p>
<p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide</p>
<p>development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation</p>
<p>efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and</p>
<p>open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership</p>
<p>with others.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and</p>
<p>redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The</p>
<p>fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,&nbsp;</p>
<p>redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved</p>
<p>names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,</p>
<p>however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The</p>
<p>requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply</p>
<p>to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
